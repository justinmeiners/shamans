/*
 The process of constructing vertices for the GUI used to be in the renderer,
 however, it started to make more sense to have it separate to reduce the amount
 of code in the renderer, and for a separation of concerns. I figure that both the 
 mesh and skel skin are already designed specifically for rendering, so the gui buffer
 is analagous to those data structure.
